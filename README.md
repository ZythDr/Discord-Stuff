Just a collection of my very amateur level Discord things as I try to learn more.

## __Mouseover Sidebar v2__ - [Preview](https://imgur.com/y962mRI)
This improved version of my Mouseover Sidebar theme takes a different approach on how the sidebars expand.

The chat will no longer be affected when the sidebars expand and collapse. 
This means that text will no longer move around on expanding/collapsing the sidebars, which results in much better performance while it also looks better.
Alongside the new approach to the animations, there are also a few new additions such as:
+ Theme only applies when window size is small. <sub><sup>(configurable size threshold by changing @media (max-width: 1130px))</sub></sup>
+ Useless icons hidden from the top bar to make it more compact and less cluttered. [Preview](https://i.imgur.com/7oHnRf8.png) 
+ Unimportant icons hidden from chat input box. <sub><sup>(Nitro Gift & Stickers button)</sub></sup> [Preview](https://i.imgur.com/DJRSllM.png)
+ Threads & Voice Channel chat overlay frame partially slides out of view to make it less intrusive. [Preview](https://imgur.com/a/yyaO8w6)

## ~~__Mouseover Sidebar v1__ - [Preview](https://imgur.com/a/ecWkt7O) (Discontinued)~~
~~This mini-theme simply makes your dm/channels sidebar very narrow to save space and expands it upon mouseover.
Sidebar width, animation speed and animation delay can be adjusted easily with a text editor or through the Discord settings if you have the [ThemeSettings](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ThemeSettings) plugin by [mwittrien](https://github.com/mwittrien).~~

__As v1 is inferior it will not be receiving any further updates.__

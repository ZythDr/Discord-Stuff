# Discord-Stuff

Just a collection of my very amateur level Discord things as I try to learn more.

__Mouseover Sidebar:__ [Preview](https://i.imgur.com/xVtIRu1.mp4) - This mini-theme simply makes your dm/channels sidebar very narrow to save space and expands it upon mouseover.
Sidebar width, animation speed and animation delay can be adjusted easily with a text editor or through the Discord settings if you have the [ThemeSettings](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ThemeSettings) plugin by [mwittrien](https://github.com/mwittrien)

# Discord-Stuff

Just a collection of my very amateur level Discord things as I try to learn more.

## __Mouseover Sidebar v1__ - [Preview](https://imgur.com/a/ecWkt7O) (Discontinued)
This mini-theme simply makes your dm/channels sidebar very narrow to save space and expands it upon mouseover.
Sidebar width, animation speed and animation delay can be adjusted easily with a text editor or through the Discord settings if you have the [ThemeSettings](https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/ThemeSettings) plugin by [mwittrien](https://github.com/mwittrien).

__As v1 is inferior it will not be receiving any further updates.__


## __Mouseover Sidebar v2__ - [Preview](https://imgur.com/y962mRI)
This new and improved version of my Mouseover Sidebar theme takes a different approach on expanding the sidebars.

The chat will no longer be affected when the sidebars expand and collapse. 
This means that text will no longer move around on expanding/collapsing the sidebars, which results in much better performance while it also looks better.
Alongside the new approach to the animations, there are also a few new additions such as:
+ Theme only applies when window size is small (configurable size threshold by changing @media (max-width: 1130px))
+ Useless icons hidden from the top bar to make it more compact and less cluttered. [Preview](https://i.imgur.com/7oHnRf8.png) 
+ Unimportant icons hidden from chat input box. (Nitro Gift & Stickers, can be reverted) [Preview](https://i.imgur.com/DJRSllM.png)
